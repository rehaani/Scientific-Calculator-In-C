# Scientific-Calculator-In-C
This is a Scientific Calculator programmed in the language C.
What are the requirements of a scientific calculator to be coded in C?

Creating a scientific calculator in C involves several steps and requirements. Here’s a breakdown of what you’ll need:

**Prerequisites**

**Basic Understanding of C Programming:** You should be familiar with variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements.

**Mathematical Knowledge:** Understanding of basic and advanced mathematical operations and functions.
Setting Up the Development Environment

**C Compiler:** Install a C compiler like GCC, Clang, or Turbo C.

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Use an IDE such as Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Visual Studio Code for a more user-friendly coding experience.


**Steps to Create the Scientific Calculator**

**Define the Functions:**

Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
Advanced operations: Exponentiation, Square root, Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), Logarithmic functions (log, ln).

**Create the User Interface:**
Use printf to display the calculator menu and options.
Use scanf to get input from the user.

**Implement the Calculator Logic:**
Call the appropriate functions based on user input.
Perform the desired mathematical operations.
