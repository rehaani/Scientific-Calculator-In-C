# Scientific-Calculator-In-C
This is a Scientific Calculator programmed in the language C.


What are the requirements of a scientific calculator to be coded in C?

Creating a scientific calculator in C involves several steps and requirements. Here’s a breakdown of what you’ll need:



**Prerequisites**

**Basic Understanding of C Programming:** You should be familiar with variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements.

**Mathematical Knowledge:** Understanding of basic and advanced mathematical operations and functions.
Setting Up the Development Environment

**C Compiler:** Install a C compiler like GCC, Clang, or Turbo C.

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Use an IDE such as Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Visual Studio Code for a more user-friendly coding experience.




**Steps to Create the Scientific Calculator**

**Define the Functions:**

Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
Advanced operations: Exponentiation, Square root, Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), Logarithmic functions (log, ln).

**Create the User Interface:**
Use printf to display the calculator menu and options.
Use scanf to get input from the user.

**Implement the Calculator Logic:**
Call the appropriate functions based on user input.
Perform the desired mathematical operations.




**Features**

**User-Friendly Menu:** The program displays a clear and organized menu for easy navigation.

**Basic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Advanced Functions:** Power, square root, sine, cosine, tangent, and logarithm.

**Loop Until Exit:** The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.




**How to Compile and Run**
1. Save the code in a file named scientific_calculator.c.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

4. Compile the program using a C compiler, e.g., gcc scientific_calculator.c -o calculator.

5. Run the compiled program using ./calculator.
